## MongoDB Commerce

Back-end project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

In this project I was able to put into practice __MongoDB__ queries to read, create, update and delete data from a collection. I worked with a fictional food commerce database, contaning data from its menu, such as ingredients, nutritional values, and sales dates.
